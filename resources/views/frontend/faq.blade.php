                        <strong>1. Does my pet really need variety in their food?</strong> <br /><br />
                        When it comes to texture, aroma and variety, our pets are so much like we humans
                        are. We get tired of eating the same thing all the time, especially if it’s bland and boring. The
                        need to have some variety in our diets is what drives us to try new foods and recipes. And
                        for the same reason your pet will walk away from food they once loved but are tired of
                        eating. Changing it up sometimes and mixing up the proteins will give your pet a renewed
                        excitement about their food. Also, different animal proteins provide different nutrients in
                        varying amounts. Feeding a variety of foods will help cover all the bases when it comes to
                        nutrition.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>2. Why should I feed my dog fresh food from Untame Pets?</strong> <br /><br />
                        Dogs evolved by our side over thousands of years, changing themselves to our
                        needs and still cannot eat everything we can. How do we expect them to consume and
                        adapt to this newly formulated, highly processed dry pellets we call dog food? We, at
                        Untame Pets aim to take a step back and produce fresh meals that your dog evolved to eat
                        and not only meet their nutritional requirements or reduce their vet visits, but bring back
                        more excitement to your beloved pooch at mealtime.
                        <br />
                        Also, if the zero additives we use to keep our food fresh and the real ingredients that
                        you can see in your dog’s bowl, as opposed to the mysterious brown balls of kibble does not
                        impress you, then the science backed claims of everything from better breath to longer
                        lifespan should!
                        <br /><br />


                        <strong>3. Why should I feed my cat fresh food from Untame Pets?</strong> <br /><br />
                        Answer for the above question is applicable here as well + Cats are only semi-
                        domesticated and are still obligate carnivores, meaning they can derive most of the nutrition
                        they need from meat. We make sure at least 90% of the nutrients for your cat is from
                        Proteins and fats. This helps reduce the incidence of feline diabetes and obesity due to high
                        blood sugar levels which is a growing problem. Also, cats evolved primarily from being
                        desert animals which explains their low thirst drive. Luckily our meals are not highly
                        processed and dry, so they contain a lot more moisture, keeping your kitty hydrated which
                        also helps reduce the risk of kidney stones and renal issues.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>4. Why is there no vegetarian option for my cat?</strong> <br /><br />
                        Cats being obligate carnivores, have deficient amounts of digestive enzymes
                        necessary to process plant material into an efficient usable energy source or biologically
                        active form. Cats have a fairly simple digestive tract and lack the ability to synthesize certain
                        amino acids from their diet. There are four amino acids (taurine, arginine, methionine and
                        cysteine) that must be provided in their diet and are best found in animal proteins, not plant
                        proteins. In addition, given their relatively short gastrointestinal tract, they have a
                        dramatically reduced ability to extract nutrients from plant material. The biological value of
                        animal protein is almost twice that of a plant protein for cats.

                        <strong>5. How does delivery work?</strong> <br /><br />
                        Delivery will be twice a week (Tuesdays and Fridays) in the mornings. Our meals will
                        arrive in single day portioned packages with resealable zippers, that way you can feed your
                        pet multiple times a day if you wish and still keep the product fresh and refrigerated without it
                        drying out.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>6. Do I have to convert my pet to fresh food completely?</strong> <br /><br />
                        While feeding fresh food has to be one of the best ways to provide your pet with
                        healthy nutrition, we understand it might not be feasible for everyone for a multitude of
                        reasons. That's exactly why we have a partial option on your order. If you choose to, you can
                        get a partial order of any of our meals and replace the other half with your pet's old food.
                        Research suggests that any amount of fresh food given to your pet is way more beneficial to
                        them than not giving any at all.
                        <br />
                        If you do opt for a partial order, please be aware that this is only 50% of your pet’s
                        daily sustenance and will not suffice their hunger or daily food requirement. It is important
                        the remainder of the meal be supplemented with their old food or something appropriate.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>7. How do I change my pet from their current diet to fresh food from Untame Pets?</strong> <br /><br />
                        Any pet which is not used to a variety of foods will take a little time to adjust to a
                        change in diet. That&#39;s why for a new pet, we automatically add a starter pack based on your
                        pet&#39;s information which will contain food for the first 5 days to aid with the transition. Replace
                        your pet&#39;s old food with 10% of fresh food from Untame Pets on day-1, on day-2 replace
                        25%, 50% on day-3, 75% on day-4 and 100% on day-5! This will help your pet get slowly
                        accustomed to the new diet.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>8. How does the food stay fresh for days?</strong> <br /><br />
                        We take the utmost care and follow proper hygiene protocols when it comes to
                        preparing and packaging your pet's meal. Packaged meals are heat sealed and refrigerated
                        to retain freshness and shelf life. Our current recommended shelf life for all our products is 5
                        days from date of manufacture.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>9. A lot of people cook at home, what's special about your recipes?</strong> <br /><br />
                        It's great for people who cook for their pets at home! But, not so great for people who
                        do not have the time, energy or the knowledge to produce balanced meals that will meet all
                        the nutritional requirements of your pet. That's where we come in! While we completely
                        endorse and encourage people taking the time to cook for their pets, we do not recommend
                        feeding unbalanced meals or human food scraps as they tend to contain ingredients which
                        are not always pet friendly and sometimes hazardous.
                        <br /><br />

                        <strong>10. What are the changes I can see in my pet?</strong> <br /><br />
                        Initially during the adjustment phase, you might notice some loose stools, which will
                        stop once the transition period is complete. In fact, you might start noticing that your pet's
                        poops are smaller and a lot less stinky, especially if you are switching from highly processed
                        dry food. It might also cross your mind that your pet is now less flatulent which makes
                        sharing any closed space with your pet more enjoyable. Pet's coats might tend to get softer
                        and shinier as they get all the healthy fats they need. Most skin related allergy/itching issues
                        might go away as they consume a more species appropriate diet with less inflammatory
                        ingredients. These are just a few things you can notice right away on the outside. There is a
                        lot more going on the inside, providing your pet with all the nutrition they require helps them
                        maintain and run their systems more efficiently which might help them keep good health and
                        maybe even live longer!
